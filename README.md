## ⚙️ Configuration

Edit `config.py` to customize:

### Trusted IPs
Add your trusted device IPs to the whitelist:
```python
TRUSTED_IPS = [
    "192.168.1.1",   # Router
    "192.168.1.10",  # Your PC
]
```

### Vulnerability Database
Modify or add new vulnerabilities in the `VULNERABILITIES` dictionary.

### Security Advice
Update port-specific security recommendations in `SECURITY_ADVICE`.
